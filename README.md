CCF: Fast and Scalable Connected Component Computation in MapReduce \
The notebook is about finding connected components of large graphs. \
It is the implementation of the proposed algorithm 'Kardes, Hakan et al. “CCF: Fast and scalable connected component computation in MapReduce.” 2014 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC) (2014): 994-998.'\
You will find here a paper describing the pseudo-code of a MapReduce algorithm
